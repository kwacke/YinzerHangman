# Yinzer Hangman

Yinzer Hangman is a console-based hangman game with a Pittsburghese twist. This is my first attempt and version of the game. I wanted to write a command line interface program just to code. My goal was make it work and now I'm working version 2 which will add more OOP principles.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) must be installed on your machine.

### How to Play

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/YinzerHangman.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd YinzerHangman
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Yinzer Hangman game.

## Gameplay

- The game selects a random Pittsburghese word or phrase.
- You have five chances to guess the word or individual letters.
- The game displays a hangman figure for incorrect guesses.
- Correct guesses reveal the hidden word or phrase.

## Customization

- Customize the list of Pittsburghese words and their hints in the `yinzWords` Dictionary.
- Modify game rules and structure in the `Main` method.
